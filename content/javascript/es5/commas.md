## Commas

  - Leading commas: **Nope.**

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var story = [
        once
      , upon
      , aTime
    ];

    // good
    var story = [
      once,
      upon,
      aTime
    ];

    // bad
    var hero = {
        firstName: 'Bob'
      , lastName: 'Parr'
      , heroName: 'Mr. Incredible'
      , superPower: 'strength'
    };

    // good
    var hero = {
      firstName: 'Bob',
      lastName: 'Parr',
      heroName: 'Mr. Incredible',
      superPower: 'strength'
    };
    ```

  - Additional trailing comma: **Nope.** This can cause problems with IE6/7 and IE9 if it's in quirksmode. Also, in some implementations of ES3 would add length to an array if it had an additional trailing comma. This was clarified in ES5 ([source](http://es5.github.io/#D)):

  > Edition 5 clarifies the fact that a trailing comma at the end of an ArrayInitialiser does not add to the length of the array. This is not a semantic change from Edition 3 but some implementations may have previously misinterpreted this.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var hero = {
      firstName: 'Kevin',
      lastName: 'Flynn',
    };

    var heroes = [
      'Batman',
      'Superman',
    ];

    // good
    var hero = {
      firstName: 'Kevin',
      lastName: 'Flynn'
    };

    var heroes = [
      'Batman',
      'Superman'
    ];
    ```
