## Strings

  - [6.1](#strings--quotes) Use single quotes `''` for strings. eslint: [`quotes`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes.html) jscs: [`validateQuoteMarks`](http://jscs.info/rule/validateQuoteMarks)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const name = "Capt. Janeway";

    // bad - template literals should contain interpolation or newlines
    const name = `Capt. Janeway`;

    // good
    const name = 'Capt. Janeway';
    ```

  - [6.2](#strings--line-length) Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should not be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

    > Why? Broken strings are painful to work with and make code less searchable.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because \
    of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
    with this, you would get nowhere \
    fast.';

    // bad
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because ' +
      'of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do ' +
      'with this, you would get nowhere fast.';

    // good
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.';
    ```

  - [6.3](#es6-template-literals) When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: [`prefer-template`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template.html) [`template-curly-spacing`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing) jscs: [`requireTemplateStrings`](http://jscs.info/rule/requireTemplateStrings)

    > Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return 'How are you, ' + name + '?';
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return ['How are you, ', name, '?'].join();
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${ name }?`;
    }

    // good
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${name}?`;
    }
    ```

  - [6.4](#strings--eval) Never use `eval()` on a string, it opens too many vulnerabilities. eslint: [`no-eval`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-eval)

  - [6.5](#strings--escaping) Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings. eslint: [`no-useless-escape`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-escape)

    > Why? Backslashes harm readability, thus they should only be present when necessary.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const foo = '\'this\' \i\s \"quoted\"';

    // good
    const foo = '\'this\' is "quoted"';
    const foo = `my name is '${name}'`;
    ```
