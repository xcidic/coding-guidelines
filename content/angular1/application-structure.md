## Application Structure

### Overall Guidelines
###### [Style [Y150](#style-y150)]

  - Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. In other words, start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. All of the app's code goes in a root folder named `app`. All content is 1 feature per file. Each controller, service, module, view is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the `app` folder. I didn't write them and I don't want them cluttering my app (`bower_components`, `scripts`, `lib`).

    Note: Find more details and reasoning behind the structure at [this original post on application structure](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/).

### Layout
###### [Style [Y151](#style-y151)]

  - Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named `layout`. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.

    *Why?*: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.

### Folders-by-Feature Structure
###### [Style [Y152](#style-y152)]

  - Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.

    *Why?*: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.

    *Why?*: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.

    *Why?*: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.

    *Why?*: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.

      ![Sample App Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/modularity-2.png)

      Note: Do not structure your app using folders-by-type. This requires moving to multiple folders when working on a feature and gets unwieldy quickly as the app grows to 5, 10 or 25+ views and controllers (and other features), which makes it more difficult than folder-by-feature to locate files.

    ```javascript
    /*
    * avoid
    * Alternative folders-by-type.
    * I recommend "folders-by-feature", instead.
    */

    app/
        app.module.js
        app.config.js
        app.routes.js
        directives.js
        controllers/
            attendees.js
            session-detail.js
            sessions.js
            shell.js
            speakers.js
            speaker-detail.js
            topnav.js
        directives/
            calendar.directive.js
            calendar.directive.html
            user-profile.directive.js
            user-profile.directive.html
        services/
            dataservice.js
            localstorage.js

        views/
            attendees.html
