## Mixins

  - [Do not use mixins](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html).

  > Why? Mixins introduce implicit dependencies, cause name clashes, and cause snowballing complexity. Most use cases for mixins can be accomplished in better ways via components, higher-order components, or utility modules.
