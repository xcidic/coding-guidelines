## Basic Rules

  - Only include one React component per file.
    - However, multiple [Stateless, or Pure, Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions) are allowed per file. eslint: [`react/no-multi-comp`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-multi-comp.md#ignorestateless).
  - Always use JSX syntax.
  - Do not use `React.createElement` unless you're initializing the app from a file that is not JSX.
