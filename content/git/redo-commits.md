## Redo commits

  - Unstage pending changes, the changes will still remain on file system

    `git reset`

  - Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally

    `git reset [commit/tag]`

  - Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit

    `git reset â€“hard [commit]`
