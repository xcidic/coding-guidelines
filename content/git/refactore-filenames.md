## Refactor filenames

  - Deletes the file from the working directory and stages the deletion
  
    `git rm [file]`
    
  - Removes the file from version control but preserves the file locally
  
    `git rm â€“cached [file]`
    
  - Changes the file name and prepares it for commit
  
    `git mv [file-original] [file-renamed]`
